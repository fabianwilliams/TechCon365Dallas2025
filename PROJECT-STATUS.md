### MCP Composition (The Innovation!)
**Status**: ✅ Designed, pending test

**Flow**:
1. Search sessions → Conference MCP
2. Read emails → Graph MCP
3. **Create calendar event** → Both MCPs working together!
4. Verify event → Graph MCP

**This demonstrates**: Two independent MCP servers coordinating through AI to accomplish a complex workflow!

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Graph Authentication Issues
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation**: Pre-authenticate before demo, test thoroughly, have screenshots

### Risk 2: MCP Composition Doesn't Work
**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation**: Test extensively, have fallback to show separately, explain concept anyway

### Risk 3: Timing Too Long
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Practice, cut content if needed, prioritize composition demo

### Risk 4: Audience Email Participation Low
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Low
**Mitigation**: Pre-seed with test emails, work with what we get, doesn't break demo

## 📝 Summary

**Status**: 67% complete, on track
**Blockers**: None
**Next Step**: Test Graph MCP
**ETA to Complete**: 2-4 hours of work remaining
**Demo Readiness**: 85% (needs Graph testing)

**Overall Assessment**: 🟢 **Excellent Progress**

The technical work is nearly complete. Both MCP servers are built following best practices. The Conference MCP is tested and working. The Graph MCP needs runtime testing but syntax is validated. Documentation is comprehensive. Main remaining work is testing Graph MCP and building the presentation.

The MCP composition feature is the key innovation and differentiator. This isn't just "look at these APIs" - it's "look at how MCP enables AI to coordinate multiple services."

**Ready to finish strong!** 🚀
