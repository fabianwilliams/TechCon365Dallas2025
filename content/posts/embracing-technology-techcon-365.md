## 🚀 Purpose

In today’s fast-paced technology landscape, I found myself immersed in my journey at **TechCon 365 Dallas 2025**. What used to take me days to achieve now unfolds in merely **two hours**. This blog explores how technology has reshaped my workflow, allowing more efficient operations while emphasizing the importance of manual oversight along the way.

During my preparation for the conference, I utilized multiple technologies including **Graph**, **MCP**, and **Agents** to create a streamlined process. While automation plays a significant role, I learned that having manual guardrails in place is essential. This realization stems from my familiarity with coding and the underlying tech, which often serves as a critical asset in navigating unexpected challenges.

> **TL;DR** - Technology has enhanced efficiency, yet human oversight remains crucial.
