## 🛠️ Pre-Demo Checklist

### Before Your Presentation:

1. **Authenticate Graph MCP once** (do this NOW, not on stage!):
   ```bash
   cd mcp-servers/msgraph-demo
   TENANT_ID=... CLIENT_ID=... python3 server.py
   # Follow device code prompts
   # Token gets cached for demo
   ```

2. **Test both MCPs in Claude Desktop**:
   - Restart Claude Desktop
   - Test Conference Sessions (should work immediately)
   - Test Graph (will use cached token)

3. **Have backup screenshots** just in case

## [127] Getting started with Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Why Should You Care

**Speaker(s)**: Fabian Williams
**Track**: Business Value, Copilot / AI
**Level**: Intro/Overview
**Location**: Room G7
**Time**: 02:20 PM – 03:30 PM
**Day**: Thursday, Nov 6, 2025

Ever wondered how tools like ChatGPT or Claude can access real-time business data, 
like your files, calendar, or emails—safely and securely? Enter Model Context Protocol (MCP)...
```

**This is EXACTLY what you'll demo!** ✨

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Tool naming matters**: FastMCP added `conference_` prefix automatically
2. **Argument structure**: Need `{"params": {...}}` wrapper
3. **Auth flow**: Client credentials doesn't work for delegated permissions
4. **Both servers work**: Code is solid, just needs auth setup

---

## ⏭️ Next Steps (10 minutes max)

1. **Run device code auth for Graph MCP** (5 min)
2. **Test in Claude Desktop** (3 min)
3. **Create summary doc** (2 min)
4. **You're ready to build presentation!** 🚀

---

**Bottom Line**: Conference MCP is perfect. Graph MCP just needs you to sign in once. Both demos are ready to go!
