Hide details

In recent years, the amount of digital content moving to

the cloud has been dramatic. This has undoubtedly made

collaboration easier and more versatile, but it's also

brought with it a new set of problems, such as non-

compliant data destruction. Additionally, since storage is

managed in the cloud, many organizations are more

aware than ever that they can't keep everything, but they

lack the capabilities to manage this redundant data.

In this workshop, your expert presenter will share his

knowledge and experience with a deep dive into what

Microsoft Purview can do to help you manage ROT

(Redundant Obsolete Trivial) in your organization while

ensuring the important and vital data is there when it

needs to be. The workshop will cover key features in

Purview, including Data Lifecycle Management and

Records Management. You will also learn the various ways

to ensure the content you need to be removed is actually

disposed of.

But it's not all theory. You'll leave the workshop with a

recommended implementation approach: a Day 1/Day

2/Day 3 incremental model that balances the user

experience and your organization's necessary protections.

Now is the time to ensure your data is safe from

accidental removal and maintained throughout its

lifecycle. Don't miss this opportunity to learn from one of

the best in the industry how to do just that.

provide consistent and reliable data in SPO by using

published tenant-level content types and managed

metadata fields via the term store, as well as other

custom column types, that can all be managed by

information architects.

As we discuss these topics throughout the day, I’ll be

sharing best practices, as well as tips and tricks that

every SPO admin should know about while working with

SPO.

Purview for Information Architects

Speakers: Marc D Anderson

Track: Content Management, Security, Governance &

Compliance

Level: Intermediate

Location: Room B

Hide details

As an information architect, you may have been ceding

understanding of Purview to others in your organization –

or ignoring it entirely, especially in smaller organizations.

The first thing many organizations want to do is apply

some level of retention (Policies or Labels) to their

content. If you don’t plan well for this, you may end up

locking down content you don’t intend to lock down, and

reversing your decisions can be difficult. This can lead to

rapid storage consumption within your tenant, among

other issues.

In the end, what you can do well in Purview is dependent

on a strong information architecture. Knowing what

content is stored where – and being able to identify it in

Purview – is the big key to success. Purview depends in

part on search, and search works well with a strong

information architecture.

If you’re embarking on this journey, perhaps due to

wanting to roll out Copilot in your organization, this

session will give you some Purview basics, considerations

to apply to your information architecture, and some of the

pitfalls we’ve seen in the field.

Empowering Site Owners to Take Control of

SharePoint Permissions & Sharing Links

Speakers: Brett Lonsdale

Track: Security, Governance & Compliance

Level: Intermediate

Location: Solution Studio

Hide details

Keeping track of who has access to what in SharePoint

Online is one of the biggest headaches for IT admins and

business users alike. Site Owners are often expected to

manage permissions and sharing responsibly, yet they’re

given little more than complex permission pages and

incomplete reports. The result? Over-sharing, compliance

risks, and frustrated Site Owners.

In this session, we’ll show how you can empower Site

Owners with the tools they need to:

Instantly report on permissions and sharing links across

their sites.

Identify external sharing risks and fix them without

raising tickets.

Schedule regular permission reviews to stay compliant.

Take action in bulk — removing sharing links, reassigning

permissions, and more.

All of this is made possible through DeliverPoint, our

SharePoint Permissions Management tool that puts

actionable, accurate reporting directly in the hands of Site

Owners.

Why you should come:

If you’ve ever worried about over-sharing in your tenant,

struggled with permission reviews, or been buried under

admin requests from Site Owners — this session will show

you how to reduce risk, save time, and empower your

users to manage permissions confidently.

How to AI enable your phone system by migrating

to Microsoft Teams and Copilot

Speakers: Jason Waite

Track: Microsoft Teams

Level: All

Location: Room D

Hide details

Copilot is already reshaping productivity across

organizations, and now IT and UC teams are expected to

make it work seamlessly.

Forward-thinking organizations that embed AI into their

UC systems are gaining a competitive edge through

automated insights, real-time call analytics, and

streamlined workflows.

With 83% of data living at the edge, your phone

conversations are a rich source of insight. When calls

happen outside the Teams environment, Copilot and your

agents lose access to that data, resulting in missed

opportunities for smarter automation and better decision-

making.

By keeping voice in Teams, every call becomes part of

your Microsoft 365 data fabric—searchable, analyzable,

and ready for AI.

That’s how you unlock the full potential of Copilot and

turn conversations into action.

Data recovery options for SharePoint/ OneDrive

Speakers: Brian Alderman

Track: Admin/Implementation, SharePoint Premium

Level: Intermediate

Location: Room G1

Hide details

SharePoint and OneDrive include several content recovery

options for SharePoint and OneDrive for Business

administrators, site collection administrators, and end

users. Educating your end users on SharePoint recovery

options like the site recycle bin, versioning, and site

collection recycle bin can lighten the burden on your

admins.

Using either a GUI or PowerShell you can backup and

restore your entire SharePoint Server farm or components

of it. In SharePoint Server you can also perform more

granular content backups by exporting site collections,

site, libraries, and lists, and there are options for

recovering these site collections, sites, lists and libraries

from content databases that are no longer part of your

SharePoint Server farm.

With a vast majority of your SharePoint Server content

stored in SQL Server it is imperative that you have an

efficient way to recover items or entire databases as

quickly as possible.

This discussion will introduce the Best Practices

framework that will allow your SharePoint Server

administrators to configure SharePoint as well as SQL

Server for quick content recovery, minimizing the

downtime and providing shorter and achievable Service

Level Agreements (SLA’s).

Copilot Studio vs. Azure AI Foundry

Speakers: Peter Carson

Track: Azure AI Studio, Copilot Studio (PVA)

Level: Advanced

Location: Room A

Hide details

AI powered agents feel like they're coming everywhere,

but how do you light up your own data in them not just

for staff, but also for external guests? How can you

incorporate an AI Agent into both scenarios securely?

We'll start the session with a level set on how AI really

works, and in particular Retrieval Augmented Generation.

A combination of Search and Large Language Models, it

lets your chat interface answer questions it hasn't been

trained by leveraging search. Built properly it also

respects security, and only answers from content the user

has access to, which can live in Dataverse, Microsoft 365,

or any other search accessible repository.

One approach we'll cover is Copilot Studio, a low-code

environment where you can build intelligent chat

experiences using ready-made large language models, a

dialog manager, and numerous data connectors. These

can be published and licensed in a variety of ways, and

can enforce security against your enterprise data.

The other approach is more code focused in Azure AI

Foundry. If you want you can get into details around

search population, chunking, AI models, and UI.

We'll also cover consumption based pricing from Microsoft

for both.

Feeling faint of heart with all this tech talk? Don't despair.

Yes we'll be showing code, but we'll also go over real-

world business cases, and the solution architectures that

leverage the Microsoft AI stacks.

Building a Policy Center with PnP Modern Search

Speakers: Marc D Anderson

Track: Content Management, Intranet & Portals/SharePoint

Level: Intermediate

Location: Room C

Hide details

In a modern Intranet, we generally want to store content

in the site where it should be managed. We think of this

as distributed content management and it's similar to the

way News works in modern SharePoint. This usually

means each department or organizational unit can

manage their content using a process which makes sense

for them.

At the same time, we may want to roll up that content in

one central location for ease of access. A Policy Center is

a great example of this approach and one we find

ourselves building for many of our clients.

In this session, you'll see how the following components

add up to make a Policy Center:

- Information architecture (IA) in the form of Site

Columns and a Content Type to represent a Policy

- A Site Template which only instantiates a Policy library

in the site and applies the IA

- A Policy library in each Intranet site, deployed using the

Site Template, with Policies specific to that department

- Changes to the search schema to support metadata

filtering

- A Policy Center page built using PnP Modern Search Web

Parts to display the Policies from across the Intranet

Additionally, we'll discuss various approaches to solve the

content management puzzle - before the Policy is even

visible on the Intranet.
